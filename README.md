# Silverstripe Search Service > Elastic

Elastic Service provider for [Silverstripe Search Service](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-search-service).

This module uses Elastic's [Enterprise Search PHP library](https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-php) to provide
the ability to index content for an Elastic App Search engine. This module **does not** provide any method for
performing searches on your engines - we've added some [suggestions](#searching) though.

## Requirements

* php: ^8.1
* silverstripe/framework: ^5
* silverstripe/silverstripe-search-service: ^3
* elastic/enterprise-search: ^8.3
* guzzlehttp/guzzle: ^7

## Installation

`composer require silverstripe/silverstripe-search-service-elastic`

## Activating EnterpriseSearch

To start using EnterpriseSearch, define environment variables containing your private API key, endpoint, and prefix.

```
ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://abc123.app-search.ap-southeast-2.aws.found.io"
ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_API_KEY="private-abc123"
ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_ENGINE_PREFIX="value-excluding-index-name"
```

## Configuring EnterpriseSearch

The most notable configuration surface for EnterpriseSearch is the schema, which determines how data is stored in your
EnterpriseSearch index (engine). There are four types of data in EnterpriseSearch:

* `text` (default)
* `date`
* `number`
* `geolocation`

You can specify these data types in the `options` node of your fields.

```yaml
SilverStripe\Forager\Service\IndexConfiguration:
  indexes:
    myindex:
      includeClasses:
        SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
          fields:
            title: true
            summary_field:
              property: SummaryField
              options:
                type: text
```

**Note**: Be careful about whimsically changing your schema. EnterpriseSearch may need to be fully reindexed if you
change the data type of a field.

## Additional documentation

Majority of documentation is provided by the Silverstripe Search Service module. A couple in particular that might be
useful to you are:

* [Configuration](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-search-service/blob/2/docs/en/configuration.md)
* [Customisation](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-search-service/blob/2/docs/en/customising.md)

## Searching

Elastic themselves provide a headless [Search UI](https://docs.elastic.co/search-ui/overview) JS library, which can
be used with vanilla JS or any framework like React, Vue, etc.

There are two main libraries:

* [@elastic/search-ui-app-search-connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elastic/search-ui-app-search-connector)
  * Provides a class to help you connect to your Elastic App Search API.
* [@elastic/search-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elastic/search-ui)
  * Provides a class that allows you to perform searches and manage your search state.

If you are using React, then there is also
[@elastic/react-search-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elastic/react-search-ui), which provides interface components.

If you are not using React, then the creation of the view will be up to you.
